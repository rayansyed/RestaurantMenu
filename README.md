This project is currenly a work in progress. &Beyond is a website that showcases the field of video game photography. This website gets updated every season which brings new "galleries" that uses can explore. As of today there are 2 galleries available for users. Kingdom and Tsushima are 2 galleries that are complete and users can download images for their personal use. In the future we want to add a showcase tab where we will feature other creators around the world and their work. My role in this project is to to develop the website and help with design when needed. The website is being developed using ReactJS combined with HTML and CSS to deliver a high quality experience. The website also supports multiple browser sizes so it can be viewed on smartphones and tablets as well. I work directly with the UI/UX team to produce multiple visual elements.

- Project: Valorant University

Valorant University is a companion applicaton for the popular FPS Valorant. This project was my capstone project to complete my undergrad, and was completed in a group of 3. The purpose of this application was to create a platform that encourages new gamers to keep playing and learning how to play. The reason we wanted to create this because the online gaming environment can be toxic for new players discouraging them for playing. My main role in this project was to develop the Augmented Reality experience. AR was used in this application in the form of quizzes, drills, and more. The AR assets were created using Reality Composer and Swift. The score that users achieved after completing quizzes were saved in our Firestore DB. Furthermore, I implemented the Achievements feature. Users could unlock achivements based on their quiz results and by just exploring the app. I also worked on designing use case diagrams, wireframes, and several other documents. Lastly, I was in charge of designing and implementing the applications UI for several components. UI components were implemented using SwiftUI.

## Inspiration

Example 1: https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/

I always loved how apple creates its web experiences when showcasing a new product. The clean design with the smooth animations makes the experience of exploring a product feel unique and exciting. It always interested me how they create these animations and how they are implemtend in the code. Experiences like inspire me becasue they open my mind in what ways websites can be delivered to users.

Example 2: https://comma.ai/

Comman AI is working on giving every car on the road today, the ability to be self driving. I think this project is really cool and very affordable compared to the competition. I have been following this project for a while and seeing it progress and become something that can be used daily is inspiring.

Example 3: https://databricks.com/

Databricks is a data analysis, AI, and machine learning tool which allows businesses to get insights as quickly and reliable as possible. The reason I find it interesting and inspiring from a technical prespective is because of how optimized it is resulting in great performance as well as how well it is designed making the overall experience great.

## Focus

During my first 6 months at CM I would love to be able to work on projects that would further develop my front end devlopment skills. I really enjoy working on web applications and would love to start my career in that role. Preferably, I would want to work on client projects as it would give me hands on experience with working on a real project. Software development tools are constantly evolving and changing and working with professionals in the industry would definitly improve my skills.

# 2022 Internship Menu Exercise

Tackle the following steps to create a menu for a "Fancy Italian Restaurant".

## 1. Sorting

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## 2. Rendering

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## 3. Styling

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.

## 4. BONUS: Filtering

- Add a checkbox to toggle spicy options. When the checkbox is checked, the spicy options should be visible. It should be checked by default.

## 5. BONUS: What You'd Change

- Create a new file called "TODO.md". Add any additional changes you'd recommend making if this was a project you were working on for a real client.
